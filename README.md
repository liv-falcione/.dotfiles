I made a bashrc to customize and add different functions. I then edited my vimrc file to further customize the color, etc. In my linux.sh file I wrote more code to run. in the cleanup.sh file I cleaned up the files so there wasn't a ton a mess. I then made a Makefile that would run my linux and cleanup files.
